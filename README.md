# Flask-Svelte-Routify
aka. the easy to use stack

## How can I use it?

First, clone the repo. Next, cd into the "front" directory. Run `npm run build`. This will build the svelte app so that it can be used by flask, our backend.

Now that the front-end is sorted, cd into the "back" directory. Run the `main.py` file and then you have your svelte app running inside Flask!
